  <!-- Heads are generally for information and customization of the website.Meta helps provide information to change some settings.Charset probably means what type of font we get,name probably lets us put things inside for us
   to be able to put "content" in right after,i am still not sure what this does.Will find out.
   Titles are for providing the name of the website that that shows up way up,not the link itself.If i dont put a title in,that name will be the name of the notepad i type on. -->

  <!-- Body has the main text in it,it consists of all the information being provided using the HTML.H1 helps make big text bigger and more noticeable.Theres H1 to H6.The lower the number,the bigger the text.Note that the / is before
   the end of every child or grandchild and so on and so on.The / is usually after every parent like headers and bodies.Theres also spaces between each parent,child and grandchild.i is for italic,b is for bold...sub is for letter drawn
   below like h2o,sup is for letter drawn up like squares...small is for making smaller words or lines compared to rest,big is for the opposite.p means paragraph. -->

  <!-- Styling is a way to customize text colors and background colors for the page to look better or show personal perspective.It can be added to any parent or child and vice versa.The whole body of the page can have a background
   color like the one i used here (background-color black).Because black is a background color which erases black text.I had to make every line that comes after have white text (style=color white).I wanted to have a positive
   message on the last text so i used the color green(style=color green).There are 140 ish colors which can be used.Mostly found after searching "w33schools css colors".The hex tags can be copied too,to have unique colors. -->
